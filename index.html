Rose Quartz Flame Ritual Guidebook
A mystical guide to love, healing, and transformation through sacred light.

Cleansing the Candle
Every Rose Quartz Flame Candle from Halo Publishing arrives pre-cleansed, anointed with essential oils, and imbued with powerful, loving intentions. This means that from the moment it’s in your hands, it’s ready to help you manifest your desires. If you’re eager to dive straight into your ritual, simply set your intention and light the flame. There’s no need to cleanse it—but if you feel called to, performing a cleansing ritual can still deepen your personal connection to the candle and the spellwork.

Here are a few optional cleansing methods, should you wish to enhance your ritual experience:

Smoke Cleansing: Pass the candle through the fragrant smoke of burning herbs, such as sage, lavender, or palo santo, while envisioning the candle glowing with pure, radiant energy.
Moonlight Bathing: Place the candle under the full moon overnight to absorb its calming and renewing energy.
Sound Cleansing: Ring a bell, chime, or use a singing bowl to surround the candle with vibrations of harmony and clarity.
Note: Whether or not you choose to cleanse your candle, it is fully prepared for your ritual. Cleansing is simply a way to create a mindful moment and invite more intention into your practice.

Setting the Space
Your ritual space is sacred. It’s a reflection of your energy and the intentions you bring to the spell. To enhance the power of your spellwork, take a few moments to prepare your environment thoughtfully.

Fire Safety First: Place the candle on a heatproof surface, away from anything flammable. Always ensure the candle is in a stable holder and never leave it unattended while burning.
Clear the Energy: Tidy up your space and consider smoke-cleansing the area to dispel stagnant or unwanted energy.
Set the Mood: Dim the lights, light some incense, or diffuse essential oils like rose or lavender. You might also want to play soft, meditative music to raise the vibration of the space.
Create a Circle of Light: Surround the candle with objects that resonate with your intention—such as crystals, flowers, or sacred symbols.
Ground Yourself: Sit quietly for a moment, close your eyes, and take a few deep breaths. Visualize roots extending from your feet deep into the earth, anchoring you in the present moment.
Declare Your Intention: Hold the candle in your hands and silently or aloud, declare what you seek to manifest. For example:
“With this flame, I call forth love and compassion.”
“With this light, I heal and release what no longer serves me.”
Spells Using the Rose Quartz Flame Candle
Each spell is crafted to harness the power of the candle’s embedded elements—rose quartz, violet petals, and essential oils—all of which are already part of the candle’s energetic makeup. You need only the candle and your intention to perform these rituals.

1. Ritual of Self-Love
Purpose: To nurture self-compassion and inner strength.

Instructions:

Prepare your sacred space and light the Rose Quartz Flame Candle.
Sit comfortably and gaze softly at the flickering flame, letting its warmth envelop you.
As you watch the flame, repeat aloud or silently:
“I honor myself. I love myself. I am worthy.”
Close your eyes and visualize a soft pink light radiating from the candle, surrounding you in a warm, protective glow. Imagine this light filling every part of you, bringing love and acceptance.
Allow the candle to burn for as long as you feel called to, then snuff it out gently (never blow it out, as this can scatter the energy). Repeat this ritual whenever you need a reminder of your worth.
2. Spell for Emotional Healing
Purpose: To release emotional pain and open yourself to peace and renewal.

Instructions:

Light the Rose Quartz Flame Candle and sit quietly before it.
Take a deep breath, and as you exhale, imagine releasing any tension or emotional pain you’ve been carrying.
With each breath, visualize the flame absorbing and transforming your pain into light.
Say aloud:
“With this flame, I release all that weighs me down. With this light, I welcome peace into my heart.”
Spend a few moments in silence, allowing the candle’s energy to soothe you. When ready, gently snuff out the candle and thank it for its aid.
3. Attraction Spell
Purpose: To draw loving, supportive energy into your life—whether romantic, platonic, or self-love.

Instructions:

Light the Rose Quartz Flame Candle in your prepared space.
Close your eyes and imagine your heart opening, like a blossoming flower, ready to receive love and connection.
Visualize the kind of relationship or energy you wish to attract—see it clearly in your mind’s eye.
Say aloud:
“I call forth love that is kind, supportive, and true.”
Open your eyes and sit in gratitude, as though your desire has already been fulfilled. Let the candle burn for a few minutes, then snuff it out.
