    <div class="section">
      <h3>⚠️ Candle Safety</h3>
      <p>Always burn your candle on a heat-safe surface. Keep away from flammable items and never leave it unattended. When using fire in rituals (especially with parchment or bay leaves), keep water nearby and work in a well-ventilated area. 🔥✨</p>
